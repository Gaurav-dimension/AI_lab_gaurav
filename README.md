📘 Linear Regression – Machine Learning Assignment
📌 Objective

The objective of this assignment is to understand and implement the complete Machine Learning (ML) pipeline using Linear Regression on the California Housing dataset.

The assignment covers:

Simple Linear Regression (single feature)

Multiple Linear Regression (multiple features)

Model training, evaluation, and interpretation

🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

The following steps are followed in both tasks:

Data Retrieval and Collection

Data Cleaning

Feature Design

Algorithm Selection

Loss Function Selection

Model Learning (Training)

Model Evaluation

Each step is clearly documented in the notebook.
